Last night while watching Shootout at Lokhandwala (SAL) I was beaming with joy, gloating in a pool of pride and all this not because I am proud of Apoorva Lakhias directorial skills but because I was spot on with my prediction. Yes people, Shootout at Lokhandwala is a complete bukwass philum. I really feel sorry for all those who expected this gangster rap to be rocking, but yaar if you mix 5 star class pasta with roadside vada paav you would only end up with beswadi khichadi.And thats exactly what SAL is, neither a classy commercial film nor a gut-retching reality flick. All you do the entire 2 hours 15 minutes is wait for this torture to get over because you can't even afford to walk off after shelling out 250 Rupees behind this miserable effort.But not to worry too much, if you have already bought the tickets and have yet to see it, here are some noteworthy aspects (and thank God for that).Now moving on to my bitchy side, here are just some of points (and a few advices) that make this film a thakela watch.As you can see from the above, I could go on and on and on but I wont.Instead I shall leave you with the most apt one-liner exhaled by some dude, once the credit titles were up - "Gupta, Kya F***all Picture Hai".
