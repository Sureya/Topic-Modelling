For those of you who still remember Sam Rainis Spiderman trilogy vividly, (considering the last film was out barely 5 years ago) Marc Webbs The Amazing Spider-Man (director of well-acclaimed indie film 500 Days of Summer) might not have anything new to offer in the larger picture. But dont we all love superhero films for its portrayal of the underdog-nerd who turns into a crime-fighter? While The Amazing Spider-Man doesnt toy with the basic graph of the film, it has enough to grab your attention and ensure a thrilling, enjoyable viewing experience.The story is more or less the same: Of a gawky-lanky Peter Parker as he discovers that he is meant for greater things. After many years of questioning his parents mysterious disappearance, we are shown his warm surroundings with Uncle Ben and Aunt May (played by the charming Martin Sheen and Sally Field). He then encounters his fathers former partner Dr Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans) genius genetic research and lends a missing algorithm to complete the research.By then hes already been bitten by the spider, and is trying to grapple with his superpowers. Hes also going through a teenage puppy infatuation with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone). Their chemistry is much more developed and crackling, which is a vast difference from the sense of achievement that you feel with Tobey Maguire and Kirsten Dunsts (from previous Spiderman films) heart-warming union. It works, regardless of the differences, because of their performances. Emma Stone is sparkling and plays the kind of girl that young boys write sonnets about (or at least the poetically inclined ones). It makes their coming together that much more magical because their chemistry has a solid build up, devoid of any meant-to-be-together undertones. Rhys Ifans as the Lizard is menacing; although you recognize the need for a more sinister villain. The scenes between Spiderman and the lizard are visually gripping though, mostly due to John Schwatrzmans swift cinematography and James Horners grand-crescendo type background score.Andrew Garfield as Peter Parker is a more nervy, nerdy teenager which works extremely well in this re-telling because the film becomes a coming of age story more than anything. While hes not a spectacled, dorky nerd, he plays the part of an outsider (the kind that prefers his skateboard to actual human company) with precision. Its the kind of performance where youre nearly expecting him to collapse with the pressure he attains after successfully transforming into Spiderman, but you know his sense of responsibility is large (You dont miss the iconic line, With great power comes great responsibility, and that is a big win for writers James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves)The Amazing Spider-Man works, mostly because of the minor nuances that have been paid attention to, to make for a fresh viewing. Be it in Parker and Gwen Stacys smile-inducing chemistry, a brief viewing of Parkers parents, the homemade costume and the fact that the spider-web in this film is web-made as opposed to the organic web from Rainis Spiderman - all only add to the charm of the film. Youre able to watch the film without making compulsive comparisons to the earlier films and youre able to love it all the same. For that reason, The Amazing Spider-Man is a must watch.
